## Part 2: Comparative Analysis (≈600 words)

### Vibe Coding vs Traditional Code Completion
Traditional code completion tools only suggest the next line or function based on syntax. Vibe coding tools understand the entire project context, user intent, and goals. Instead of completing a line, they can create files, refactor code, and debug logic.

### Vibe Coding vs GitHub Copilot
GitHub Copilot focuses on inline suggestions. Vibe coding tools allow conversational interaction, where the developer can say “build a todo app with persistence” and the AI creates a working solution across multiple files.

### Vibe Coding vs ChatGPT in Browser
Using ChatGPT separately requires copy-pasting code and explaining context repeatedly. Vibe coding tools are integrated into the IDE, meaning they already know your file structure, errors, and dependencies. This leads to faster iteration and fewer mistakes.

### Pros and Cons
**Pros:**
- Faster development
- Beginner-friendly
- Handles boilerplate code

**Cons:**
- Can generate bugs
- Over-reliance risk
- Less learning if used blindly

### Conclusion
Vibe coding tools are best for rapid prototyping, learning, and small to medium projects. Traditional coding is still essential for deep understanding and complex systems.
