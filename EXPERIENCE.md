# Vibe Coding Experience

## Tool Selection Justification
I chose Replit Agent because it provides a fully integrated development environment with AI assistance. It is beginner-friendly and allows building complete applications using natural language prompts.

## Development Process
I described the project idea to the Replit Agent and asked it to create a simple todo application. The AI generated the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. I refined the output with small adjustments.

## Challenges and Solutions
Some UI details were basic, so I manually improved readability. The AI occasionally generated extra code, which I simplified. Overall, the AI reduced setup and debugging time significantly.

## Reflection
Vibe coding surprised me with how fast a working application can be created. It changed my workflow by focusing more on ideas rather than syntax. I would use this tool again for small projects and prototyping. In the future, vibe coding could make software development more accessible.
